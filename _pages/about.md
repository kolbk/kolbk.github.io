I am Katharina, a PhD Student at the [Chair of Econometrics](https://oekonometrie.wiwi.uni-halle.de/) at [Martin Luther University Halle-Witternberg](https://www.uni-halle.de/) Before starting my PhD, I worked as a researcher at [Leipzig University](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/) and [Research Institute Social Cohesion](https://fgz-risc.de/). 

I am an applied microeconomist working at the intersection of spatial economics and individual outcomes. My research explores topics in labor, migration, and environmental economics. In my dissertation, I investigate how local shocks impact subjective well-being.
